                <h2>Summary of modules</h2>
                <h3>Lesson 1</h3>
                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the set of markup codes and symbols inserted into a
                    file intended for display on the Internet.
                    The markup tells web browsers how to display a page’s words and images. HTML is the primary tool for
                    front-end developers. Thanks to it, we can
                    create various elements on our website. After creating them, we can use Cascading Style Sheets to
                    change their location and improve their appearance.
                    We can also bind JavaScript code to them to make them interactive. In this lesson, we’ll create a
                    simple website using only HTML.
                    We’ll learn about elements such as headings, paragraphs and links to make our text display
                    correctly. This lesson will help us understand more
                    complex elements of HTML, which we’ll learn about later.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="summary">
                <h3>Lesson 2</h3>
                <p>We already have some essential knowledge about HTML and HTML elements and attributes. In this lesson, 
                    we’ll learn about some more complicated HTML elements widely used on most web pages. Buttons are a 
                    perfect way to interact with the user. Using them can tell the application we want to start or end 
                    some action. Images are probably even more critical. They make our website attractive and can be used 
                    like regular buttons. We’ll learn about presenting our data using lists and tables. Lists and tables 
                    help divide our data into smaller, corresponding parts, and we can also highlight crucial information. The 
                    last things we’ll focus on in this lesson are text formatting and styles. Thanks to them, we can make our 
                    data look better and easier to read. Even inside the prettiest table, text in a tiny font will be tough to 
                    read. Only savvy users of all the above elements can guarantee our data is presented attractively.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="summary">
                <h3>Lesson 3</h3>
                <p>We already know how to create a simple website with various elements such as buttons, images, texts, tables, 
                    etc. While it’s enough that our website has all the significant functionalities like interacting with the 
                    user and showing the necessary data, it doesn’t look as good as most websites on the Internet. Fortunately, 
                    we have Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Thanks to them, we can apply various styles to make our elements look great. 
                    We can move our elements to the place they fit best. We can also change their details, such as size or colour, 
                    to match the others. We’ll introduce CSS in this lesson, show how to access HTML elements and apply styles without 
                    using the style attribute. We’ll also go through colour, text, shadow and size manipulation. The last thing we’ll 
                    do is manage the visibility of the elements on our website.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="summary">
                <h3>Lesson 4</h3>
                <p>We already know how to select elements in CSS and manage their size, colour or visibility. In this lesson, 
                    we’ll learn how to position them so they look better and the breaks between them are sized correctly. To achieve this, 
                    we’ll learn how to separate adjacent elements with borders. Borders allow us to see where our elements end. Even in our 
                    tables, it wasn’t that clear thus far. However, we don’t always want our elements to have a visible border. Fortunately, 
                    we can use margins and paddings to manage the breaks between the elements, and they are entirely invisible. We’ll also 
                    learn how to position an element on our website. To achieve this, we’ll learn how to change the float and position properties.
                    In the end, we’ll also create some basic animations to show that CSS can help us create dynamic websites without JavaScript.</p>

                <h3>Lesson 5</h3>
                <p>This is a self-study lesson which consolidates knowledge of the first module. You can refresh your memory of HTML and CSS by 
                    watching HTML and CSS tutorials and then completing a series of small HTML and CSS tasks.</p>
