        <h2>Summary of modules</h2>
        <article class="lessons">
            <div class="summary">
                <h3>Lesson 1</h3>
                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the set of markup codes and symbols inserted into a
                    file intended for display on the Internet.
                    The markup tells web browsers how to display a page’s words and images. HTML is the primary tool for
                    front-end developers. Thanks to it, we can
                    create various elements on our website. After creating them, we can use Cascading Style Sheets to
                    change their location and improve their appearance.
                    We can also bind JavaScript code to them to make them interactive. In this lesson, we’ll create a
                    simple website using only HTML.
                    We’ll learn about elements such as headings, paragraphs and links to make our text display
                    correctly. This lesson will help us understand more
                    complex elements of HTML, which we’ll learn about later.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="summary">
                <h3>Lesson 2</h3>
                <p>We already have some essential knowledge about HTML and HTML elements and attributes. In this lesson,
                    we’ll learn about some more complicated HTML elements widely used on most web pages. Buttons are a
                    perfect way to interact with the user. Using them can tell the application we want to start or end
                    some action. Images are probably even more critical. They make our website attractive and can be
                    used
                    like regular buttons. We’ll learn about presenting our data using lists and tables. Lists and tables
                    help divide our data into smaller, corresponding parts, and we can also highlight crucial
                    information. The
                    last things we’ll focus on in this lesson are text formatting and styles. Thanks to them, we can
                    make our
                    data look better and easier to read. Even inside the prettiest table, text in a tiny font will be
                    tough to
                    read. Only savvy users of all the above elements can guarantee our data is presented attractively.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="summary">
                <h3>Lesson 3</h3>
                <p>We already know how to create a simple website with various elements such as buttons, images, texts,
                    tables,
                    etc. While it’s enough that our website has all the significant functionalities like interacting
                    with the
                    user and showing the necessary data, it doesn’t look as good as most websites on the Internet.
                    Fortunately,
                    we have Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Thanks to them, we can apply various styles to make our
                    elements look great.
                    We can move our elements to the place they fit best. We can also change their details, such as size
                    or colour,
                    to match the others. We’ll introduce CSS in this lesson, show how to access HTML elements and apply
                    styles without
                    using the style attribute. We’ll also go through colour, text, shadow and size manipulation. The
                    last thing we’ll
                    do is manage the visibility of the elements on our website.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="summary">
                <h3>Lesson 4</h3>
                <p>We already know how to select elements in CSS and manage their size, colour or visibility. In this
                    lesson,
                    we’ll learn how to position them so they look better and the breaks between them are sized
                    correctly. To achieve this,
                    we’ll learn how to separate adjacent elements with borders. Borders allow us to see where our
                    elements end. Even in our
                    tables, it wasn’t that clear thus far. However, we don’t always want our elements to have a visible
                    border. Fortunately,
                    we can use margins and paddings to manage the breaks between the elements, and they are entirely
                    invisible. We’ll also
                    learn how to position an element on our website. To achieve this, we’ll learn how to change the
                    float and position properties.
                    In the end, we’ll also create some basic animations to show that CSS can help us create dynamic
                    websites without JavaScript.</p>

                <h3>Lesson 5</h3>
                <p>This is a self-study lesson which consolidates knowledge of the first module. You can refresh your
                    memory of HTML and CSS by
                    watching HTML and CSS tutorials and then completing a series of small HTML and CSS tasks.</p>

        <h2>Summary of modules</h2>
        <article class="lessons">
            <div class="summary">
                <h3>Lesson 1</h3>
                <p>We already have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this lesson, we’ll learn how to
                    connect and change our elements dynamically. We can do this thanks to the HTML Document Object Model
                    (DOM)

                    We’ll learn about the general idea and schema of HTML DOM. After this lesson, we’ll know how to find
                    the elements we’re looking for with DOM and change their values. We’ll also add new values and
                    remove the old ones.

                    The last thing presented in this lesson is about changing the content of the HTML elements and their
                    attributes. We can present our content in HTML dynamically, meaning the content will be determined
                    when the program is run. Otherwise, our website content is predefined and static.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="summary">
                <h3>Lesson 2</h3>
                <p>We already know what HTML DOM is and how to use it. In this lesson, we’ll learn more details about
                    it. We’ll learn about forms, events and nodes while improving our knowledge about other DOM uses,
                    like collections.

                    Forms enable us to group controls and validate their values. We’ll learn more about data validation,
                    why it’s crucial, and the concept of constraint validation. We’ll also create animations with
                    JavaScript, not with CSS (transitions, animations) but ‘manually’.

                    We’ll then focus on events and event listeners and the possibilities they provide. We’ll conclude
                    with nodes and collections, which will allow us to insert or remove the elements at the selected
                    places.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="summary">
                <h3>Lesson 3</h3>
                <p>We already know how to interact with our HTML code when using HTML DOM. In this lesson, we’ll learn
                    about a new possibility: interacting with our browser. The Browser Object Model (BOM) provides us
                    with the objects that expose the web browser’s functionality.

                    In this lesson, we’ll focus on the window, screen, location, history and navigator objects. We’ll
                    see how to create various interactions with the user and gather fascinating user data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="summary">
                <h3>Lesson 4</h3>
                <p>We already know the majority of BOM elements. In this lesson, we’ll recap alerts and timers. There’s
                    also a brand-new topic – cookies.

                    We learned a bit about alerts and timing and then used them as the black box – we learned what
                    command we should call to create a black box but didn’t know anything about the structure behind it.
                    With the knowledge about HTML DOM and BOM, we now understand how they work.

                    The last topic is cookies. Cookies are the data stored in small text files within the user’s
                    computer. Usage of them allows the website to gain legible information about the user.</p>

                <h3>Lesson 5</h3>
                <p>This is a self-study lesson which consolidates knowledge of the second module. You’ll have the chance
                    to recap HTML DOM and solve some exciting exercises connected to it.</p>
