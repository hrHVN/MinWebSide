            <h2>Lesson 1 - HTML basics</h2>
            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the set of markup codes and symbols inserted into a
                file intended for display on the Internet.
                The markup tells web browsers how to display a page's words and images. HTML is the primary tool for
                front-end developers. Thanks to it, we can
                create various elements on our website. After creating them, we can use Cascading Style Sheets to
                change their location and improve their appearance.
                We can also bind JavaScript code to them to make them interactive. In this lesson, we'll create a
                simple website using only HTML.
                We'll learn about elements such as headings, paragraphs and links to make our text display
                correctly. This lesson will help us understand more
                complex elements of HTML, which we'll learn about later.</p>

            <h2>Lesson 2 - HTML basics</h2>
            <p>We already have some essential knowledge about HTML and HTML elements and attributes. In this lesson,
                we’ll learn
                about some more complicated HTML elements widely used on most web pages. Buttons are a perfect way to
                interact
                with the user. Using them can tell the application we want to start or end some action. Images are
                probably even
                more critical. They make our website attractive and can be used like regular buttons. We’ll learn about
                presenting
                our data using lists and tables. Lists and tables help divide our data into smaller, corresponding
                parts, and we
                can also highlight crucial information. The last things we’ll focus on in this lesson are text
                formatting and styles.
                Thanks to them, we can make our data look better and easier to read. Even inside the prettiest table,
                text in a tiny
                font will be tough to read. Only savvy users of all the above elements can guarantee our data is
                presented attractively.</p>

            <h2>Lesson 3 - CSS basics</h2>
            <p>We already know how to create a simple website with various elements such as buttons, images, texts,
                tables, etc.
                While it’s enough that our website has all the significant functionalities like interacting with the
                user and showing
                the necessary data, it doesn’t look as good as most websites on the Internet. Fortunately, we have
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
                Thanks to them, we can apply various styles to make our elements look great. We can move our elements to
                the place
                they fit best. We can also change their details, such as size or colour, to match the others. We’ll
                introduce CSS
                in this lesson, show how to access HTML elements and apply styles without using the style attribute.
                We’ll also go
                through colour, text, shadow and size manipulation. The last thing we’ll do is manage the visibility of
                the elements on our website.</p>
