    <h2>Course Assignment Resources</h2>

    Read the course assignment instructions carefully. If you should not understand anything, please contact one of the teachers. You are not allowed to discuss the course assignment in any class channels. The course assignment grade is pass / not pass
    
    IMPORTANT!: Complete the Course Assignment by following the instructions given below. 
    
    Your GIT repository in this Assignment needs to be private. 
    
    Make sure to give 'JoshNoroff' and 'FJ-teach' access to your repository in GitHub.
    
    
    <h2>- Download the web application -</h2>
    Download the pre-created web app files from this repository:
    
    https://github.com/FJ-teach/fet-ca-1.git
    
    You will need to either download the .zip file, or clone the Course Assignment code (pre-created web app) to your computer through VSCode.
    
    Then create your own private repository on GitHub, named “Fname_LName_FET” (Replace ‘FName’ with your First Name, and ‘LName’ with your Last Name). 
    
    Make your initial commit with the comment “Initial Commit Aug22CA”.
    
    Make sure that throughout this Course Assignment, you commit a version of your code to your repository at least 1 more time, other than the initial commit and the final commit.
    
    <h2>- Welcome -</h2>
    Create a ‘welcome.js’ file in the correct folder. In this file, create a jQuery function that selects the HTML element with the “liveToastBtn” ID and shows the HTML Toast element with the ID of ‘liveToast’. This function should be run when the user clicks the ‘Like’ button in the HTML header.
    
    Make a copy of the ‘Like’ button element in the HTML file and place it directly after the existing ‘Like’ button element. Change the button text to “I’m Bored” and the element’s ID to “boredBtn”. In the same ‘welcome.js’ file, create another function that executes a GET Request to the “https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity/” API, once the new “I’m Bored” button is clicked. The response from this API Request should be logged into the web console.
    
    
    
    
    
    <h2>- Table -</h2>
    Create a ‘table.js’ file in the correct folder.
    
    Use this file to populate the Table in the ‘personal’ section as follows, using Vanilla JavaScript:
    
    You need to have 5 rows of data.
    Populate the table with data of your choice that is relevant to the table headers.
    The Table needs to be populated from the 'table.js' file you have created
     The following functionality needs to be implemented in the ‘table.js’ file, using jQuery:
    
    When one of the images in the Table is clicked, the image needs to be displayed in a new window in your web browser.
    The table’s odd rows need to change font color when the mouse hovers over them, changing font color back to black once the mouse stops hovering over them.
    
    
    <h2>- About me -</h2>
    Create an ‘aboutMe.js’ file in the correct folder.
    
    In this file, you must create functions to update the ‘about me’ content.
    
    Change all the "Something about me text" to something about you when the page loads. This could be anything, hobbies, what you like or do not like, your pet's names, or where you live. All the "Something about me text" needs to be changed from the function. The information can be real or made up
    
     When you click the content that you have updated, the background color needs to be powderblue, and the font color needs to change to white.
    
    
    
     <h2>- Contact Information -</h2>
    Create a ‘contact.js’ file in the correct folder.
    
    In this file, you must create a single function with the following 3 variables:
    
    email
    telephone_number
    address
     In the index.html file, in the ‘contact’ section, add a Button.
    
    When this button is clicked, the following should happen in the function created above:
    
    1. Ask the user for information.
    
    You must store this information in the 3 variables created in the contact.js file. Make sure that data is received from the user input, and that it is in the correct format (e.g., make sure the user enters an email address containing both a '@' and '.' ).
    
     2. Change the current contact information (email, telephone number, and address) to the input data in these 3 new variables.
    
    This must be done using jQuery selectors, without adding more HTML IDs to the ‘contact’ section.
    
     3. Print the data entered to the console in the following format:
    
    From: email@emailaddress.co.za
    Contact: 0458754125
    Address: 12 Smith Road, John Park.
    
    
    <h2>- Accessibility -</h2>
    Create an ‘accessibility.js’ file in the correct folder.
    
    In the Accessibility’ section, we have a visual aid for users who struggle to read small font, in the form of a Toggle Switch. When the user clicks this Toggle Switch to the ‘On’ position, all text on the web page within <p> tags need to be increased by 20%. When the user clicks the Toggle Switch back to the ‘Off’ position, all text on the web page within <p> tags need to be decreased back to the original size. Create a single function in the file that accomplishes this.
    
     
    
        <h2>- GIT -</h2>
    When you have completed your web app, commit your final code to your GitHub repository in a final commit with the comment “Final Commit Aug22CA”.
    
    As stated at the beginning of this assignment, access to your repository must be given to the following accounts:
    
    “JoshNoroff” and “FJ-teach”.
    
    This access ensures that your code can be cloned to be marked. Failure to be given access to download the code/web app will result in a failed mark.
    
    
    
    How to give access to your private repository:
    
    1.	On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of your private repository.
    2.	Under your repository name, click the “Settings” tab.
    3.	In the "Access" section of the left sidebar menu, click “Collaborators”.
    4.	In the “Manage Access” section of the page, click “Add people”.
    5.	In the search field, type the account name you wish to give access to.
    6.	Select the name in the list of matches
    7.	Click “Add x to this repository”
    8.	Do this for both “JoshNoroff” and “FJ-teach”.
    
    
    <h2>- Finally -</h2>
    Finally, the link to your repository needs to be submitted on Moodle, in a .txt file named the following:
    “FName_LName_FET_CA_AUGFT22.txt” - if you are a Full-Time student,
    “FName_LName_FET_CA_AUGPT22.txt” - if you are a Part-Time student
    
    (Replace ‘FName’ with your First Name, and ‘LName’ with your Last Name). 
    
     NOTE: This .txt file is the ONLY submission for this Course Assignment. (In this .txt file, you have to add your repository link to which you have committed your web application code.)
