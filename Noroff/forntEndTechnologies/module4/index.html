            <h2>Bootstrap P1</h2>
            <p>We already know how to apply various styles to our website with CSS. Unfortunately, this task usually
                demands a lot of time and creativity. Moreover, good programmers don’t always have to be good designers
                too. Sometimes it’s better to use already created solutions instead of making everything from scratch.
            </p>
            <p>In this lesson, we’ll learn how to use the most popular style library – Bootstrap. We can use it to get
                already-created high-quality styles and components and use them in our application. We’ll install
                Bootstrap and check its documentation. Every major class or component is described with examples.</p>
            <p>Since Bootstrap is a free and open-source library, the material will be divided into two lessons. In this
                lesson, we’ll learn Bootstraps basics, such as installation, basic setup and using various classes and
                elements.</p>

            <h2>Bootstrap P2</h2>

            <p> We already know how to use the standard Bootstrap classes to change our styles. In this lesson, we’ll
                focus more on the website’s design. We’ll learn about the grid concept, most likely the most distinctive
                part of Bootstrap. With columns and flexboxes, we can design a responsive website quickly.</p>
            <p>Later in this lesson, we’ll go through the most valuable components, starting from common ones like
                buttons and navbars and finishing with the more complex ones like toasts or carousels.</p>
            <p>We’ll learn how how to customise components provided by Bootstrap and make them responsive. We’ll create
                our own buttons, navbars, toasts and carousels.</p>

            <p>Bootstrap provides many more components, but we’ll focus on the most popular ones, as we won’t be able to
                cover all possible components in this lesson. We can always learn more in the Bootstrap documentation.

            <h2>User Experience</h2>
            <p>
                Whether we’re creating a small blog site or a project for a big corporation, we should never forget that
                a good user experience makes users stay on our website. With simple interaction design principles, we
                can make our website behave in a way that users expect and enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far, we have learned more about CSS and Bootstrap styles. We know how to create various components
                but not how to connect them into one consistent whole, which makes users enjoy using the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this course, we’ll learn the User Experience principles and how to create good content with the tools
                we already learned in previous courses. With this knowledge, we can create more extensive projects.

            <h2>
                Web Apis
            </h2>
            <p>
                In web development, information between server and client is exchanged using requests. Web API enables
                us to execute these requests. So far, we don’t have enough knowledge to create our API, but in this
                lesson, we’ll learn how to use an external one.
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ll learn about the API and how to connect to it with requests. External APIs usually have
                documentation, so we’ll learn how to use it to get the information to connect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, we’ll connect to the external GIPHY API and try to retrieve the necessary data from the returned
                response.

            <h2>
                Self Study
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is a self-study lesson which consolidates knowledge of the fourth module. You will have the chance
                to remind yourself of Bootstrap, user experience and API and solve some interesting exercises connected
                to them.
