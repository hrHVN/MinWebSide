        <h2>Lesson 4 - CSS basics del 2</h2>
        <p>We already know how to select elements in CSS and manage their size, colour or visibility. In this lesson,
            we’ll learn how to position them so they look better and the breaks between them are sized correctly.
            To achieve this, we’ll learn how to separate adjacent elements with borders. Borders allow us to see where
            our elements end. Even in our tables, it wasn’t that clear thus far.
            However, we don’t always want our elements to have a visible border. Fortunately, we can use margins and
            paddings to manage the breaks between the elements, and they are entirely invisible.
            We’ll also learn how to position an element on our website. To achieve this, we’ll learn how to change the
            float and position properties. In the end, we’ll also create some basic animations to show that CSS can help
            us create dynamic websites without JavaScript.</p>

            <h2>The Task</h2>
            <p>This lesson taught us about positioning our elements, adding necessary breaks and basic transitions. In
                this task, you need to create a menu similar to this one:
                <img src="https://core-noroff.bravais.com/api/dynamic/documentVersions/14681/files/131152/media/Back-end/Front-End%20Technologies/Images/CSSbasics(part2)task-1.png"
                    alt="The Task case">
            </p>
            <p>The menu should have three panels that take up 90% of the screen’s width. After hovering on the panel,
                it should change colour and double its height. The text needs to be centred. The menu needs to float to
                the left. Remember to add necessary breaks between menu panels and padding.</p>
