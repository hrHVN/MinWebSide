            <h2>Lesson 1 - jQuery (part 1)</h2>
            <p>jQuery is one of the most popular, free, open-source JavaScript libraries, enabling us to handle everyday
                tasks with significantly smaller code. It provides us with multiple features from the topics we learned
                in previous classes, such as HTML/DOM manipulation, CSS manipulation and animations. It also smooths
                cross-browser development issues, as it runs the same in all major browsers.

                In this lesson, we’ll learn how to set up the jQuery library. We’ll then focus on jQuery basics, such as
                selecting the correct element with the CSS selector and getting connected to this element with our
                document’s tree structure.

                Even though there are many other JavaScript libraries, jQuery is probably the most popular and
                extendable. We can even create our plugins with it, but we won’t learn about this in this lesson as it’s
                a more advanced topic. This is why jQuery is used on the web by some of the biggest companies, such as
                Google, Microsoft, IBM and Netflix.</p>

            <h2>learning outcomes</h2>
            <h4>In this lesson, we are covering the following knowledge learning outcomes:</h4>
