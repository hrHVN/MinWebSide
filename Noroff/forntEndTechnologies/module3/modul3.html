        <h2>Lesson 3 - GIT Part 1</h2>
        <p>Git is the state-of-the-art technology for version control in almost any field of programming. Source control
            lets us see our code history, work on one project simultaneously with other people, or even revert recent
            changes and restore the old app version without needing a local backup.

            GitHub is the most popular code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. After creating a
            GitHub account, we can work together on projects from anywhere. We can also look at other people’s projects.
            Projects are usually organised in repositories. Repositories are typically private before project
            completion. After completing the project, we can make them public, show our code to our friends or inspire
            anyone in the world.

            In this lesson, we’ll learn how to install Git on our computer and create our GitHub account. We’ll also
            create our first repository, check the VS Code Git extension, use them to create our first files and push
            them to the GitHub platform.</p>

        <h3>learning outcomes</h3>
        <h4>In this lesson, we are covering the following knowledge learning outcomes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The candidate has knowledge of concepts, processes, and tools of Git version control software.

                <li>The candidate masters JavaScript tools, materials, techniques, and styles to enhance functionality
                    in static web pages, both inline scripting and external script files.</li>
                <li>The candidate masters Git source control tools, materials, techniques, and styles to create and work

            </ul>

            <h4>In this lesson, we are covering the following general competence learning outcome:</h4>

            <h2>Activity 4.1</h2>
            <p>Create a simple.js file and commit it to the repository.</p>

            <p><em>This entire project is synced trough Git since the first letter.</em> There fore i'll ignore these
                kind of tasks, and if you'd like to see my public repos <a

            <h2>The Task</h2>
            <p>This lesson taught us about Git basics, such as Git setup, creating a GitHub account, repository, and
                commits. We saw how to push the last to the remote repository.</p>
            <h4>In this task, you need to:
            </h4>
            <ol>
                <li> Create a new repository.</li>
                <li>Open it in VS Code.</li>
                <li>Create a file “Test.txt” and put some text in it.</li>
                <li>Create a commit containing the file creation.</li>
                <li>Push the commit to the remote repository.</li>
                <li>Change the file again, but from GitHub.</li>
                <li>Create another commit with the file change.</li>
                <li>Pull remote changes from VS Code.</li>
