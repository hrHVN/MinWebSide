            <h2>Introduction to OOP - pt1</h2>
            <p>In this lesson, we'll recall basic information about Objects, how to create them and how to access or
                modify their properties and methods.</p>
            <p>In JavaScript, all values, besides primitives, are Objects. Primitives are types and values such as
                string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol or bigInt. </p>

            <h2>Introduction to OOP - pt2</h2>
            <p>Now, we'll look at classes as Objects and learn about Object constructors, prototypes and iterables.</p>
            <p>Finally, we'll go through the most popular Global Objects. Due to Global Objects, we can access various
                built-in functionalities connected to, for example, math or date operations.</p>

            <h2>JSON - pt1</h2>
            <p>In this lesson, we'll learn JSON basics, such as JSON rules, structure, conversion and the most popular
                libraries supporting it.</p>
            <p>JSON is used widely in data exchange, such as API requests and responses or configuration files. In the
                past, XML language was used in these areas, even though JSON is significantly easier for humans to read.
                It also needs fewer characters to code the data, which can save resources while working with massive
                data.</p>

            <h2>JSON - pt2</h2>
            <p>The last topic we'll learn about in this lesson is JSON for Linked Data (JSON-LD). This is based on the
                JSON format but adds more rules, so data is organised better. Since this format is prevalent, there's a
                significant chance that external JSON objects will also be in this format.</p>

            <h2>Self Study</h2>
            <p>This is a self-study lesson which consolidates knowledge of the first module. It contains videos
                reminding parts of working with JavaScript Objects and JSON.</p>
