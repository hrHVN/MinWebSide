            <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular format for sharing data online. Its structure is based on
                JavaScript syntax. However, it isn't only for working with JavaScript but numerous other technologies.
            </p>
            <p>JSON is used widely in data exchange, such as API requests and responses or configuration files. In the
                past, XML language was used in these areas, even though JSON is significantly easier for humans to read.
                It also needs fewer characters to code the data, which can save resources while working with massive
                data.</p>
            <p>In this lesson, we'll learn JSON basics, such as JSON rules, structure, conversion and the most popular
                libraries supporting it. This subject is split into two lessons. The more complex details of JSON are
                addressed in the next lesson.</p>
