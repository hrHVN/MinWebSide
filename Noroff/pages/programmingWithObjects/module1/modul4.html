            <p>In the previous lesson, we learned about JSON basics. We already know how to create JSON objects, why
                they
                are important and how to convert them to other data types. This lesson will focus on more advanced
                details,
                such as various types and conventions of creating JSONs.
            </p>
            <p>Working with JSON objects isn't always easy. They can be enormous and organised differently than we
                expect.
                JSON Schema is a standard for creating schemas which work as JSON object's documentation. We'll learn
                how to
                create and generates our own schemas.</p>
            <p>The last topic we'll learn about in this lesson is JSON for Linked Data (JSON-LD). This is based on the
                JSON
                format but adds more rules, so data is organised better. Since this format is prevalent, there's a
                significant chance that external JSON objects will also be in this format.</p>

                <h4>The Task</h4>
                <p>This lesson taught us complex information about JSON, such as JSON Schemas and JSON-LD.</p>
                <p>In this task, you need to create a JSON Schema for the following object:</p>
                <img src="../media/thetask4.png" alt="">
                <p>Each property is required.</p>
                <p>Try to create the schema yourself and then check the schema generated by https://www.jsonschema.net.
                    Compare them.</p>
