            <h2 class="modal-header">Lesson 1 Intro to Objects</h2>
            <p>In JavaScript, all values, besides primitives, are Objects. Primitives are types and values such as
                string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol or bigInt. However, even these can be represented as
                Objects.</p>
            <p>We can treat Objects as containers for data. Object properties and Object methods can store numerous
                variables and functions.</p>
            <p>In this lesson, we'll recall basic information about Objects, how to create them and how to access or
                modify their properties and methods. More complex details on Objects will be presented in the next
                lesson.</p>

                <h4>The Task</h4>
                <p>In this lesson, we learned about Object Oriented Design. In this task, you need to create a use case
                    diagram for a pizza delivery system using one of the UML software mentioned at the beginning of the
                    lesson, based on the following user stories:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Customer:
                        <ul>
                            <li> Must first log in to access the system</li>
                            <li>Can view menu</li>
                            <li>Can view total bill</li>
                            <li>Can order pizza</li>
                            <li>Can view order tracking</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>Admin:
                        <ul>
                            <li> Must first log in to access the system</li>
                            <li> Can add and delete positions in menu</li>
                            <li> Can manage orders status</li>
                            <li> Can manage payment</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>Chef:
                        <ul>
                            <li> Can view customer's pizza orders</li>
                            <li>Prepares ordered pizza</li>
                            <li>Receives order</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>Delivery:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Receives order</li>
                            <li>Delivers pizza to customer on time</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
