                        <p>This lesson guides through the installation process of Visual Studio Code and presents a
                            basic website structure. Examples of a standard web application are presented and explained.
                        </p>
                        <p>The lesson also provides an introduction to computer programming. We’ll learn about variables
                            and the basic operations we can exert on them.</p>

                            strings. Familiarity with strings is beneficial for a JavaScript developer.</p>
                        <p>In this lesson, we’ll discuss three different types of conditionals. We’ll also discuss the

                        functionalities are separate, you can do them in whichever order you prefer (Except for
                        Function 8, which requires Function 7 as a prerequisite).</p>
