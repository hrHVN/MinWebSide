            <h2>To sum up this course, we should:</h2>
            <ol>

                <li>Keep things simple:
                    <ul>
                        <li>all content has a reason for being on the website</li>
                        <li>we used the minimum possible amount of text</li>
                        <li>all of our graphic elements are relevant and show unique information.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Keep things consistent:
                    <ul>
                        <li>our menus, headings and all other design elements have the same style within the entire
                            website</li>
                        <li>we presented information in a similar style on the entire website.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Keep things standard:
                    <ul>
                        <li>our website looks similar to other websites</li>
                        <li>we used popular solutions for our components, or at least, we made our components behave the
                            same way as the most popular ones</li>
                        <li>our website works correctly on the older browsers as well.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Considered our users:
                    <ul>
                        <li>our website was created for users, not us; the user’s primary goal is to find the
                            information they’re looking for as quickly as possible, and we should help them</li>
                        <li>we should think of our target users and present the information in the most convenient way.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>The Task</h2>
            <p>This lesson taught us about standard User Experience (UX) basics. In this task, you need to ask the
                following questions:</p>
            <ol class="list-group">

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    A visitor has reached your website from a search engine. What do you need to consider about the
                    information displayed on the pages?
                    <ul>
                        <li class="list-group-item">The information on the page should direct the visitor to the site’s homepage, where they can
                            get more information.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item bg-success text-light">Each page should outline the site’s content so visitors can access the relevant information.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item bg-danger">Each page should contain a site map so visitors can find the necessary information.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    When simplifying your site’s design, what question should you ask yourself?
                    <ul>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Is the amount of text on the page sufficient?</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Should each page contain additional images?</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item bg-success">Does each element on the page help or hinder visitors?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Before adding different forms of media (video, audio, or interactive content) to your pages, what should you ask?
                    <ul>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Will this grab people’s attention?</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Will this slow down page load times?</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item bg-success">Does this enhance my visitors’ experience?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Adding interactive content to a page can be helpful to demonstrate product features, teach concepts, or give immediate feedback. But what should you keep in mind?
                    <ul>
                        <li class="list-group-item">You should make sure it’s eye catching so people are encouraged to use it.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item bg-danger">You should ensure the interactive content is truly educational.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item bg-success">You should ensure the interactive content is truly educational.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    After developing your information architecture, you realise you have five main menu items. Which type of menu interface are you most likely to choose?
                    <ul>
                        <li class="list-group-item">A vertical menu on the right-hand side of the page.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item bg-success">A horizontal menu just beneath the page header area.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">A vertical menu on the left-hand side of the page.</li>
                    </ul>
