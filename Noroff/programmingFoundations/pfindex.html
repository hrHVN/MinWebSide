                            basic website structure. Examples of a standard web application are presented and explained.
                        </p>
                        <p>The lesson also provides an introduction to computer programming. We’ll learn about variables

                        <p>In this lesson, we’ll discuss three different types of conditionals. We’ll also discuss the

                        knowledge. The project is focused on HTML and JavaScript, and you will need to correct
                        programming errors in 10 functionalities you have already learned about. All these
                        functionalities are separate, you can do them in whichever order you prefer (Except for
                        Function 8, which requires Function 7 as a prerequisite).</p>
