                        <pre>
In this lesson, we learned some crucial concepts of Object-oriented Programming. 
We learned about classes, encapsulation and inheritance.

In this task, you have to create a menu for a restaurant. 
Every dish has a name and price. Our restaurant serves pizza, pancakes and pasta. 
In addition, pizza has an array of ingredients, and pancakes have the Boolean sweet property, which defines whether pancakes should be served sweet. 
Pasta has the Boolean property isVegetarian, which defines whether it contains meat.

Create a model in Object-oriented Programming simulating the menu. 
Think about which properties should be private and which not.

                    <h4>Part 2</h4>
                        <p>
                            In this lesson, we learned about new data structures. We also learned what an algorithm is and gained insight into three basic sorting algorithms. We saw that JavaScript offers a good alternative – a sort() function.

                            In this task, you’ll have to sort the numbers, but to make it more interesting, you won’t sort them from smallest to greatest. First, you need to get two numbers from the user. You can use prompts to do that. Both need to be positive integers. The bigger one defines the size of your array.
                            
                            We can generate the array of the provided size this way:
                            <code> numbers = Array.from(Array(10).keys()); // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</code>
                            We want to sort all elements by the remainder when dividing by the second, smaller parameter. If the remainder is the same for two numbers, the smaller one should be before the greater one. We can get the remainder through the modulo operator:
                            <code>(11%4); // 3</code>
                            Our sorted array will look this way for the size of the array equal to 10 and second parameter 3
                            <code>[0, 3, 6, 9, 1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 8]</code>
                            Please print the result in the console.
                            
                            You should implement sorting in two ways:
                            Using any of the basic sorting algorithms mentioned in this lesson or any other sorting algorithm found on the Internet that is no less optimal.
                            Using the sort() method.

In this lesson, we learned about basic asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Now we know what callbacks, timeouts and intervals are. We can also create asynchronous code with promises.

In this task, you’ll create a number guessing game. You have to get the number from the user (via prompt) and check if the number is the same as the one you hardcoded in the JavaScript file. If the values differ, you should ask the user again after 10 seconds. If the values are the same, you should end the game and congratulate the user with an alert.

                        <p>In the first part, we’ll add new customers to our restaurant. The customer gives their name and asks about a table of a specific size. If we have a table of this size, we should tell them its identifier and add them to our customer’s array. Otherwise, we should ask them about providing a smaller size until we get the correct one.</p>
                        <p>In this section, we’ll enable the attack of sneaky customers. A sneaky customer sits at a random table without us noticing. We’ll add two buttons: one to enable and one to disable the sneaky customer’s attack. If enabled, one random customer with a random name will sit at a random table every 30 seconds. Every time a new sneaky customer is added, we should print “Shhhhhhhh” in the console.</p>
                        <p>If we only add new customers, our restaurant will get too crowdy. In this section, we’ll implement a tool to free a table. We want to remove all customers from the table of a provided index. We get the index via prompt as often as necessary until it’s in the correct format.</p>
